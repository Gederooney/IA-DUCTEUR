Nature's symphony, a melody so sweet
Birds singing, leaves rustling, in rhythm so neat
Breeze blowing, waves crashing, a chorus so grand
A serenade to the beauty, a treasure so grand.

The sun sets, stars twinkle, the moon shining bright
A canvas of colors, a sight so right
The night sky, a masterpiece, a work of art
Nature's symphony, a treasure in the heart.

All around, the beauty, a wonder so true
Nature's symphony, always singing anew
A reminder of life, a reminder to care
For the symphony of nature, a treasure so rare.
